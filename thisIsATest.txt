This is a test project for setting up the server properly

Heres how the workflow shoud go.
1) do local work
2) git push to the cluster 
    local $ git push cluster master

3) On the cluster, pull from the origin.
    remote $ git pull origin master

4) run the script to get a notebook window
5) work in the notebook








# This requires two git repositories because git doesn't like pushing to non-bare repos. Even if you do, it doesn't update the files in the currently checked-out branch.

Setting things up: ( this is a bit stupid, but it works....)

1) Make the cluster remote:
    remote $ source proSetup MYPROJ

2) setup local remote:
    local $ git remote add cluster ssh://LR93@orchestra.med.harvard.edu/home/lr93/projects/sourceRepos/MYPROJ.git

3) push to the cluster
    local $ git push cluster master

3) on the cluster, pull from the bare repo:
    remote $ git pull origin master
